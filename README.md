# Smart-Parking-Spaces
There are three components of this application:
•	Parking Management Server (PMS) – monitors all the parking spaces and also manages metering and billing for all users.
•	IoT hardware platform – connects the parking spaces to PMS and also detects the presence or absence of a vehicle.
•	Mobile App – offers an easy interface to assist the driver to find a vacant space and manage his parking usage and billing.
